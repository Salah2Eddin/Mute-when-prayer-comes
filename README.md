# Mute when prayer comes
 Mutes your computer when prayer time comes for five minutes\
 It uses an api provided by(https://aladhan.com) to get the prayer times \
 than when prayer time comes it will mute your computer\
 after five minutes it will unmute it\
 it checks for prayers every half a minute


Also my api token for ipinfo is hardcoded .. feel free to use it\
but it would be better to just get yours from their site if you will use\
this for something else\
it's free\
